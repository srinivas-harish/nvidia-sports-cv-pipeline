# Sport CV Pipeline ‚Äî NVIDIA RTX 5070‚ÄØTi Showcase

A computer-vision inference stack engineered to saturate the RTX 5070 Ti‚Äôs Tensor Cores with real-time sports analytics. 9.49 ms avg forward pass (FP16, batch=4, 1080p). Frame-perfect at 60 FPS input with zero backpressure. HUD overlays benchmarked in OpenCV.

Engineered with NVIDIA to demonstrate the raw throughput of the RTX‚ÄØ5070‚ÄØTi. The system blends YOLOv9c detection, ByteTrack association, Kalman‚Äëfilter ball estimation, and a suite of domain‚Äëspecific analytics (speed & distance, ball possession, team assignment) under a TensorRT‚Äëaccelerated inference core.

This pipeline shows that with consumer‚Äëgrade GPUs (RTX‚ÄØ5070‚ÄØTi), broadcast‚Äëquality multi-object sports analytics can run in real‚Äëtime without server‚Äëclass hardware. It‚Äôs a reference design for edge‚Äëdeployed sports AI: modular, deterministic, and optimized.

## Features

- **YOLOv9c + ByteTrack + Kalman fusion** ‚Äì Player/referee detections feed a ByteTrack association pass with tuned thresholds (`track_activation_threshold=0.25`, `lost_track_buffer=30`, `minimum_matching_threshold=0.95`) while a 4‚Äëstate Kalman filter interpolates up to 12 missing ball frames  
- **Ball possession acquisition** ‚Äì Ball is assigned to the nearest player foot if within 70‚ÄØpx, enabling possession stats and HUD callouts  
- **Jersey‚Äëcolor team clustering** ‚Äì KMeans on cropped torso patches clusters players into two jersey colors and caches assignments for subsequent frames  
- **Perspective homography + physics metrics** ‚Äì A pitch‚Äëcalibrated homography projects pixel positions to meters; smoothed speed (km/h) and cumulative distance (m) are computed with per‚Äëplayer histories and sanity checks  
- **Camera motion compensation** ‚Äì Lucas‚ÄìKanade optical flow on masked border features estimates camera translation every N frames, with motion interpolation between calculations  
- **Per‚Äëplayer possession analytics** ‚Äì Frame‚Äëlevel possession streaks and totals are tracked for top‚ÄëN leaderboards and overlay stats  
- **Realtime HUD toggles** ‚Äì Halos, speed/distance, camera motion, ball possession and frame info overlays can be toggled live via keyboard shortcuts
